## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TalentMatch.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

  * `listjob` : Lists all job entries.

  * `addjob jt/Software Developer jr/3 k/JavaScript`: Adds a job titled `Software Developer` to TalentMatch.

  * `deljob 3` : Deletes the 3rd job shown in the current list.

  * `clear` : Deletes all entries.

  * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [k/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe k/Python` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[k/SKILL]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `k/Python`, `k/Java k/Python` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All prefixes and commands used in TalentMatch are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `N/NAME P/PHONE_NUMBER` is not acceptable.
  e.g. if the command specifies `addjob jt/JOB_TITLE`, `ADDJOB JT/JOB_TITLE` is not acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Job commands should be called only in job view while person commands should be called only in person view. This is to ensure you can see real time updates in response to their queries.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

TalentMatch data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TalentMatch stores data in two separate JSON files:
* `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` - Contains all person and job data
* `[JAR file location]/data/applicationbook.json` - Contains all application data linking persons to jobs

Advanced users can update data directly by editing these files, but caution is advised.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data files make their format invalid, TalentMatch will handle it as follows:

1. If you correctly edit the files and maintain valid format:
   * TalentMatch will load your edited data on next startup
   * All relationships between persons, jobs, and applications will be preserved
   * Your changes will be immediately reflected in the UI

2. If the address book file is invalid or missing:
   * TalentMatch will load sample data for both persons/jobs and applications
   * A warning will be logged, but the application will still start

3. If only the applications file is invalid or missing:
   * TalentMatch will keep the existing persons/jobs data
   * It will create a new, empty applications manager
   * This means all links between persons and jobs will be lost

4. If both files are valid but contain inconsistencies:
   * Applications referring to non-existent persons or jobs may cause unexpected behavior

It is strongly recommended to:
* Back up both data files before editing them
* Keep the file format and data consistent across both files
* Restart the application after making direct edits to verify your changes
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
